# Vendor Trash

Crafting idle game idea. You're not the adventurer, you're the shopkeeper. 


## Premise

You are the son of a late shop keeper, who died during a goblin ransack of your town last week. You come home and inherit his shop, and pledge to help the town get back on its feet. Warriors from across the land have flocked to your town once they heard of the goblin invasion, and intend to drive them off, and they need someone to buy their vendor trash and sell them new weapons and armor.

## Gameplay

You start off by running the only workshop of your father's that is still left standing: The carpentry. Warriors sell you vendor trash, and you need to break it down into base elements and then craft them into items to sell. At some point you make enough money to hire people to perform these tasks for you, which automates the duties but cuts into your profits. 

You will also be able to send adventurers on quests to search for materials for you, for a price. At first they'll only be able to get base materials, but as they level up they'll be able to find more and more advanced items as well. Adventurers will request a downpayment for quests due to the inherent risks of adventuring... and there's a chance they never come back. Whether they've failed in the quest and died, or took the money and ran, anything goes. 

At some point you will expand your shop. Each town will have limited space available and you will eventually grow to consume it all. Then you must expand your operations to other towns. Other towns have access to different kinds of materials and different adventurers, but you'll still need to import materials from your other shops to make complex items. Then you must manage transportation by buying a fleet of wagons and drivers, and mercenaries to protect them in transit. 

## Types of Shops

* Carpentry (wood)
* Sewing (cloth)
* Tanning (hides)
* Smithing (metal)
* Jeweling (gems)
* Alchemy (potions/poisons)
* Enchanting (magic)
* Cooking (food)
* Farming (food base items)?

## Adventurers

* Adventurers in a single town will come from a small (12-20?) pool of persistent people. 
* It is assumed that the adventurers will stay in the area while you are running it. 
* That way you get to know the adventurers and what they are capable of. 
* The amount of time they take to come back depends on how easy the quest is, which gives players an indication of how each adventurer handles quests.
* If you send a guy off on a quest and he gets defeated, it's your fault for giving him something that's too hard. 
* If an adventurer never comes back with your items, but keeps coming back to your shop to sell stuff, you can probably take note and raise prices on that person to recoup your downpayment. They'll be more likely to pay since they need to sell their stuff somewhere.
* Adventurers suffer perma-death. And you can accidentally kill all the adventurers in the town. Each one gone makes quests even harder, because there's more and more badguys and less goodguys, making the world more dangerous. 
* You will have to bring more adventurers in by paying them to be mercenaries if that happens. 
* Adventurers will have a level, and will demand higher level products as they progress through the area.
* At a certain point, adventurers leave an area when they outlevel it, and they will move onto the next area. 
* Adventurers that "graduate" are replaced by newbies, so mercenaries aren't needed in these instances.
* Adventurers have classes that determine what types of items they will generally be buying.
* The game will remember adventurer's inventory so they can come back and sell you the wrecked versions of what you sold them earlier. 
* The game will simulate an adventurer's outing, without too much detail, but will keep track of items they win and their health as they adventure.
* The adventurer will decide to return if 1) they get tired, 2) they run out of inventory space, 3) they complete their quest, 4) their health falls too low and they need to heal up.
* Adventurers can have preset personality traits: Untrustworthy, Honest, Foolhardy, Cautious, Cheap, Spendthrift, etc.

## Your Shop

* You set your prices and negotiate until they leave, buy, or sell.
* Adventurers sell old items they no longer need
* Adventurers sell vendor trash
* Adventurers come in looking for specific item types, around their level.
* An adventurer can decide that you simply have nothing to offer and leave. You will know what they are looking for so you can craft it before they come back. 
* When not dealing with an adventurer, you can repair, dismantle, or craft items in your workroom to prepare your inventory. 
* Storage space will be limited but expandable. 
* Each crafting type requires a new workroom. 
* Items within your shop in a single town will be accessible to all workrooms within that shop, immediately.
* Items from shops in other towns must be transported via caravan.
* You will have the option to dispatch an adventurer on a quest.
* You define quests in terms of how much of what items you want, and how much you are willing to pay for it. 
* The downpayment is 50% of the cost of the quest. 
* The game will limit you to only creating quests for items that can be found in the current area.
* The game will allow you to save your quest so that you can dispatch it multiple times. 
* An adventurer may decide that a quest is too difficult or dangerous to do, and decline. The Foolhardy/Cautious traits affect this decision.
* The game will automatically calculate a suggested payout for a quest which will result in a 75% acceptance rate for an adventurer with no personality trait modifiers who is the same level as the highest level item in the quest package. 
* When workers come into play, you set the desired markup% and markdown% for items the adenturers buy and sell. 
* When workers come into play, you set the desired average acceptance rate for quests. 

## Workers

* You will want to automate all of this as quickly as possible by hiring workers. 
* Each worker has one primary skill and cannot transfer to another one. 
* Workers will be hireable and fireable. 
* Workers gain proficiency the longer they work for you. 
* Workers demand more money as their skills increase.
* Workers can quit if not paid enough. 

## Types of Workers

* Customer Service - automatically buys and sells items based on markdown/markup values, and dispatches quests to adventurers based on the desired average acceptance rate.
* Woodworker
* Tanner
* Tailor
* Smith
* Jeweler
* Alchemist
* Enchanter
* Cook
* Farmer
